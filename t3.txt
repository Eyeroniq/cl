1. Dataset: Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher.

It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Each sample has 4 features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Goal: Predict the species based on these 4 features.

2. Data Splitting: train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(...)
This splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

random_state=42 ensures reproducibility of the split.

3. Feature Scaling: StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
Standardization ensures each feature has:

Mean = 0

Standard deviation = 1

Helps algorithms like Logistic Regression converge faster and perform better because they are sensitive to feature scales.

4. Model: Logistic Regression

logreg = LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
Theory of Logistic Regression
A linear classification algorithm.

It predicts the probability of a class using the sigmoid function in binary classification or the softmax function in multiclass problems.

For multiclass classification, LogisticRegression in scikit-learn uses one-vs-rest (OvR) strategy by default.

For multiclass, probabilities are computed for all classes, and the class with the highest probability is chosen.

5. Model Evaluation

y_pred_train = logreg.predict(X_train_scaled)
y_pred_test = logreg.predict(X_test_scaled)
Predictions are made for both training and test sets.

accuracy_score(y_train, y_pred_train)
Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions to total samples.

Training Accuracy: Measures how well the model learned from the training data.

Testing Accuracy: Measures generalization to unseen data.

6. Classification Report

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_test))
Provides detailed performance metrics:

Precision: 
How many selected items are relevant?

Recall (Sensitivity): 
How many relevant items are selected?

F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Support: Number of actual occurrences of the class in the test set.
