1. Origins and Motivation
Big Data Challenge
Traditional, single‐machine algorithms buckle under massive datasets (terabytes–petabytes). Google introduced MapReduce (2004) to let thousands of commodity servers jointly process enormous web‑scale data reliably and efficiently.

Functional Roots
MapReduce borrows from the functional programming primitives:

map(f, collection) applies a function f to every element, yielding intermediary results.

reduce(g, collection) aggregates those results using a binary operator g.

2. Logical Data Flow
A. Map Phase
Input: A collection of records (e.g., lines in text, rows in logs).

Operation: User‑supplied Map function takes each record and emits zero or more key‑value 
Goal: Extract the “keys” you care about (words, user IDs, timestamps) along with partial values.

B. Shuffle & Sort
Partitioning: All emitted pairs are grouped by key across the cluster—this is often called the “shuffle.”

Sorting: Within each partition, keys are sorted so that all values for the same key are collated.

C. Reduce Phase
Input: For each unique key K, the framework provides the list of values 

Operation: User‑supplied Reduce function processes these lists to produce final output 
Goal: Aggregate, filter, or otherwise summarize per‑key data (e.g., sums, averages, concatenations).

3. Execution Architecture
Master Node
Coordinates the job: splits input, schedules Map/Reduce tasks, monitors progress, handles failures.

Worker Nodes
Run Map tasks on input splits, write intermediate files.
Run Reduce tasks on shuffled data partitions, write final results.

Reliability
If a worker fails, the master reassigns its tasks to other nodes (thanks to idempotent, stateless Map/Reduce functions).

Data Locality
Scheduler tries to run Map tasks on nodes where the data block already resides, minimizing network I/O.

4. Performance Optimizations
Combiners
A “mini‐reduce” that runs on Map outputs locally, pre‑aggregating values (e.g., summing word counts before shuffle) to cut down network traffic.

Partitioners
Control how keys are assigned to reducers (e.g., hash-based or range-based), balancing load across reducers.

Speculative Execution
Slow “straggler” tasks are redundantly launched elsewhere; the one that finishes first wins, speeding up the overall job.

5. Fault Tolerance & Scalability
Stateless Tasks
Map and Reduce functions do not share mutable state; they rely solely on their input. This makes re‑execution trivial if a node fails.

Lineage Tracking
The master knows how to recompute any lost intermediate data from the original inputs.

Horizontal Scaling
More nodes → more parallel Map/Reduce slots → near‐linear speedup (until bottlenecks like network or disk I/O dominate).

6. Use Cases
Batch Analytics
– Word‐count, log analysis, inverted index construction

Data Transformation
– ETL (extract‑transform‑load) pipelines, format conversions

Graph Processing (via iterative MapReduce)
– PageRank, connected components

Machine Learning
– Distributed computations of model parameters (e.g., aggregating gradients)

7. Limitations & Successors
High Latency
MapReduce jobs have nontrivial startup, shuffle, and teardown overhead—unsuited for real‑time analytics.

Iterative Algorithms
Each iteration spins up a full MapReduce job; frameworks like Apache Spark or Flink with in‑memory persistence offer dramatic speedups for iterative workloads.

Rigid Programming Model
Only two stages (map, reduce); more complex pipelines require chaining multiple jobs
