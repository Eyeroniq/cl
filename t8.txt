1. MapReduce Paradigm
MapReduce is a computational framework designed for parallel and distributed processing of large-scale data.

It splits data processing into two main stages:

Map: Filters, transforms, or restructures data into intermediate key-value form.

Reduce: Aggregates or summarizes data based on keys or groupings.

Even though the implementation here is not distributed, the logical pattern of Map → Reduce is preserved in the way data is filtered and then summarized.

2. DataFrame as a Dataset
In Pandas, a DataFrame serves as a tabular dataset, similar to a database table or spreadsheet.

It allows for:

Column-based filtering (used in the "map" step)

Group-based aggregation (used in the "reduce" step)

This supports in-memory analytics at high speed for moderate-sized data.

3. Filtering (Map Phase)
Filtering rows based on Boolean conditions simulates the map operation.

Example: Selecting all rows where Survived == 0 and Sex == 'male' is equivalent to extracting key-specific records in a MapReduce system.

4. Aggregation (Reduce Phase)
Aggregation functions such as:

.mean() — for computing average values

.value_counts() — for counting occurrences per group

These replicate the reduction phase, where intermediate data are consolidated into summary statistics.

5. Statistical Summarization
Computing mean age gives insight into demographic patterns among deceased males.

Value counts by class highlight survival trends by socioeconomic factors among deceased females.

This reflects typical use cases in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and descriptive statistics.

6. Application: Titanic Dataset
Commonly used for educational purposes in data science.

Contains demographic and survival data for passengers.

Serves as an example to apply conditional filtering, grouped aggregation, and data summarization.

7. Non-distributed MapReduce Simulation
While traditional MapReduce is meant for distributed environments (like Hadoop or Spark), Pandas enables:

A local, in-memory simulation

Sequential execution of Map and Reduce logic
