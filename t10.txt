Neural style transfer leverages a pretrained convolutional neural network—in this case, VGG‑19—to decompose an image into two complementary sets of features: content and style. In this framework, the “content” of an image is represented by the activations at a higher convolutional layer (here, conv_4), which capture the spatial arrangement of objects, while “style” is represented by the correlations between feature maps at multiple layers (conv_1 through conv_5), quantified via Gram matrices that measure how strongly different filters fire together regardless of spatial location. A randomly initialized (or content‐cloned) image is treated as the optimization variable: we iteratively adjust its pixel values so that its feature activations match those of the content image (minimizing mean‐squared error to the target content features) and its Gram matrices match those of the style image (minimizing mean‐squared error to the target style correlations). To make these comparisons meaningful, each input is first normalized using the same channel‐wise mean and standard deviation as the network’s training data; this “Normalization” layer ensures that the pretrained filters respond correctly. The style‐transfer objective is a weighted sum of style loss (with a large weight, e.g. 1e6) and content loss (with weight 1), striking a balance between preserving the content structure and imposing the style’s texture and color statistics. Optimization is performed with the L‑BFGS algorithm, which is well‐suited for this small parameter space (the pixels themselves) and converges quickly in practice; within each iteration, the image’s pixel values are clamped to [0,1] to ensure valid RGB intensities. By backpropagating the combined loss through the fixed VGG network into the image tensor, the algorithm “paints” the content image in the style of the reference artwork, producing a final stylized image whose high‐level structures reflect the content and whose low‑ and mid‑level statistics reflect the style.
