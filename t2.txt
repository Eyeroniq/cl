A distributed factorial service built on Remote Procedure Call (RPC) begins with the fundamental premise of treating a remote computation—here, the calculation of n!—as if it were a local procedure call. Under the covers, however, the client and server each incorporate specialized “stubs” (client stub and server stub) that automatically marshal (serialize) function arguments into a network‐friendly format, transmit them over a chosen transport (such as TCP or HTTP/2), and then unmarshal (deserialize) the data on the other side. This stub‐based abstraction hides the complexity of networking from application programmers: clients invoke a Factorial(n) function call in their code, and stubs handle packing n into a message, sending it to the server, awaiting the response, and returning the computed result back to the caller.

Defining the precise interface for such an RPC service typically involves an Interface Definition Language (IDL), which is a language‐neutral schema describing available service methods and data types. For our factorial service, an IDL specification would declare a method like long Factorial(in long n) throws InvalidArgument;, making explicit that inputs below zero (or above some practical maximum) should trigger an error. From this IDL, tooling can generate strongly typed client proxies and server skeletons in multiple programming languages, ensuring that both ends agree on data layouts, error codes, and versioning.

Communication semantics in RPC can be either synchronous or asynchronous. In a synchronous call, the client blocks until the server computes the factorial and returns; this is simple to program but can tie up threads under high latency. Asynchronous RPC allows the client to dispatch a request and continue doing other work, later retrieving the result via callbacks, futures, or polling. Semantics around failure—at‐most‐once versus at‐least‐once execution—must also be chosen. With “at‐most‐once,” the system ensures that even on retries it will not compute n! more than once, avoiding duplicate side effects (though factorial is idempotent). With “at‐least‐once,” retries may lead to multiple executions, which is typically safe for pure mathematical functions but must be handled carefully if stateful operations are introduced.

The choice of transport and wire format plays a significant role in performance and interoperability. Binary protocols such as Protocol Buffers or Apache Thrift yield compact, efficient encodings, reducing bandwidth and serialization overhead. Textual protocols like JSON‐RPC or XML‐RPC, by contrast, are human‐readable and easier to debug but carry greater message size. Underlying transports—reliable, ordered TCP versus connectionless UDP—further influence design: UDP-based RPC must incorporate its own mechanisms for packet loss, retransmission, and ordering.

On the server side, concurrency models range from a simple thread‐per‐request (where each incoming RPC is handled by a dedicated thread) to event‐driven architectures using nonblocking I/O and worker pools. Stateless servers—where each request is independent—scale more readily behind load balancers, allowing multiple instances to serve factorial requests without complex session management. Performance optimizations such as memoization or caching of recent factorial results can slash computation time for hot values, while batching requests can amortize network latency when clients need multiple factorials at once.

The client likewise must manage timeouts, retries, and error handling. A sensible timeout prevents a hung or slow server from blocking client resources indefinitely; exponential back‐off algorithms help avoid overwhelming a recovering server with retry storms. RPC frameworks often translate server‐thrown exceptions (like InvalidArgument) into client‐side exceptions or error codes, enabling developers to design robust recovery logic or user‐friendly error messages.

Finally, any production‐grade RPC service must consider security and reliability. Transport‐level encryption (TLS) protects the confidentiality and integrity of factorial requests and results. Authentication schemes—ranging from API keys to mutual TLS or OAuth tokens—ensure that only authorized clients can invoke the service, while authorization policies can limit usage to certain integer ranges or rate‐limit calls per user. To achieve high availability, multiple server replicas can run behind a load balancer, with health checks removing unhealthy instances and circuit breakers preventing cascading failures if the compute cluster becomes overloaded.

In sum, designing a distributed factorial application via RPC involves more than writing a simple loop for n!. It requires a holistic approach—defining precise interfaces, choosing appropriate marshalling and transport layers, architecting for concurrency and fault tolerance, and embedding security—so that callers enjoy the illusion of a local function call while benefiting from the scalability and resilience of a distributed system.
