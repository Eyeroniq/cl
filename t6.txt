üèóÔ∏è Data Modeling & Relationships
6. What is a data model in Power BI?
A data model in Power BI is a collection of tables with relationships that allow for efficient data analysis and reporting.

7. How do relationships work in Power BI?
Relationships in Power BI define how data in one table relates to data in another. They can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.

8. What is the difference between a star schema and a snowflake schema?

Star Schema: A central fact table connected to dimension tables.

Snowflake Schema: A more normalized form where dimension tables are further broken down into sub-dimensions.

9. What are cardinality and cross filter direction?

Cardinality: Defines the nature of the relationship (e.g., one-to-many).

Cross Filter Direction: Determines how filters flow between tables in a relationship.

10. What is the use of "Composite Models"?
Composite models allow combining data from different sources, enabling both DirectQuery and Import modes in a single report.

üßÆ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
11. What is DAX in Power BI?
DAX is a formula language used in Power BI for creating custom calculations and aggregations on data. 
Medium

12. Explain the difference between SUM() and SUMX().

SUM(): Adds up all values in a single column.

SUMX(): Iterates over a table, evaluating an expression for each row and then summing the results.

13. What is the purpose of CALCULATE() in DAX?
CALCULATE() evaluates an expression in a modified filter context, allowing for complex calculations.

14. How does ALL() work in DAX?
ALL() removes filters from a table or column, returning all rows regardless of any filters applied.

15. What is row context vs filter context in DAX?

Row Context: The context of a single row during calculations.

Filter Context: The set of filters applied to data during evaluation.

üìä Visualization & Reporting
16. How do slicers work in Power BI?
Slicers are visual filters that allow users to segment data dynamically within reports.

17. What are bookmarks, and how are they used?
Bookmarks capture the current state of a report page, including filters and visuals, allowing users to navigate between different views.

18. What is drillthrough in Power BI?
Drillthrough enables users to navigate from one report page to another, focusing on a specific data point or context.

19. What is the difference between page-level and report-level filters?

Page-Level Filters: Apply to a single report page.

Report-Level Filters: Apply to all pages within the report.

20. What is conditional formatting in Power BI?
Conditional formatting allows for dynamic styling of visuals based on data values, enhancing report readability.

üîí Security & Access Control
21. What is Row-Level Security (RLS)?
RLS restricts data access for users based on filters defined within roles, ensuring users see only data pertinent to them.

22. How can you implement RLS in Power BI Desktop?
By defining roles and DAX filters under the "Modeling" tab and assigning users to these roles in the Power BI Service.

23. What is the difference between static and dynamic RLS?

Static RLS: Fixed filters applied to roles.

Dynamic RLS: Filters based on user attributes, allowing for more flexible access control.

24. How is data security managed when publishing reports to the service?
Through workspace permissions, RLS, and dataset security settings in the Power BI Service.

25. Can users with access to the report edit the underlying dataset?
